Quiche is a simple and lightweight utility that could help you to **save computation time, networked queries**.
At the moment, it's mostly a caching system for your Python functions.

Just add the `Quiche.cached` to your functions and the result will come from the cache if a recent version of the result exists in it, otherwise your function will run like every time before. Look at example.py to get help.

## üî® Installation

Copy the `quiche.py` file in your project folder. It only require the Python's standard library.

## ‚öñÔ∏è License
